1. OAuth2 Authentication:
The script uses the google-auth-oauthlib and google-auth libraries to handle OAuth2 authentication, which is more secure than using plain text passwords.
The authenticate_gmail function handles the authentication process, including refreshing the token if necessary.
2. IMAP Authentication with OAuth2:
The generate_oauth2_string function creates the OAuth2 string needed for authentication with Gmailâ€™s IMAP server.
This approach is more secure and in line with Google's requirements for accessing Gmail via IMAP.
3. Fetching and Saving Emails:
The script fetches all emails from the inbox and saves them as text files in a specified directory.
